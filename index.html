        <h1 class="heading">Sufism</h1>
        
        <p>
            <b>Tasawuf:</b>otherwise known as sulook,sufism or Mystism -is the soul of Islam.
            This fact is recognized as such by all the great authorities of Islam.it is a process
            where by the person's soul is purified and reformed by sujecting it to spiritual
            training under the supervision of a spiritual guide called sheiky or Murshid.
            Tasawuf is an internal of a spiritual aspect of islam that employs mercy
            and love as its operation tools.
            Tasawuf with its principles of love for and Knowledge of Allah is like a ladder,
            used in gaining closeness to Allah.
            In the the light of the above, one see that good manners and character are unattainnble
            outside the concept of Tasawuf,while Tasawuf cannot be applied without toriqah;itself may
            not function outside the sharia; for anything outside the sharia is not within the deen of
            islam.whatever is not islam will not be accepted by Allah on the day of reckoning.
            In this wise it is mandatory for every muslims to take to the part toriqah for spiritual training
            if one wishes to move from the level of Muslim to mumim and ultimately to that of Al-insan.
            The path of toriqah ecompasses zuhd (Ascetism) Takwa (Allah's consciousness) and ihsan (God deeds).
            In recognition of the above, the heart needs training in order to attain nobility.Peace and traquility,
            medical ailments of the patient - similarly the service of a specialist in the path
            of toriqah are essetial in matter of tasawuf. Therefore self mortification is the first step in
            path of toriqah.The path opens wide for the taking  this first step and remain closed
            to the who cannot humble himself.
            All the past prophets Allah underwent one from  spiritual training or the other.
            Even the holy prophet muhammed (S.A.W) has this training before and after his prophethood and
             the I'tikaf observed in the mosque at the last days of ramadan are testimonies to the This
             assertion.before the israi and miraj, the extra ordinary things during his heavely voyage
             to Almighty Allah.Thus if the prophets of Allah could under go spiritual training and
             purification of the heart, how can ordinary people like us to without this process? Once the heart is perfect
             and purified through spiritual training, it will be able to see and understand what the 
             physical eyes cannot see and what the mind cannot ordinary understand.
             It is therefore your duty as a muslim to  struggle with your soul, This
             being the major jihad emphasized by the holy prophet; this is the effect that the soul
              may be deliver from reprehensible attributes through their subtituion by praise wortht ones.
              Since the path of toriqah provides means of turnig ones heart with love and respect towards
              Allah and His messager, it therefore follows that those friends of Allah who have place the love
              of Allah and his messager at the center of their herts have become friends of all
              humanity.Being around such men of tasawuf enables one to derive benefit from their spiritual
              flood and ultimately passing the benefits so derived to others
               in the community. Through love, tasawuf establishes spiritual
               bond between the disciple(murid) and his master (sheikh).
               Once the murid loves and respects the sheikh, the actions of
               the sheikh are imitated and such murid benefits immensely from 
               the spiritual flood of sheikh.In this regard the guidance of one's sheikh along the path
               of toriqah serves to ward off mishap or obstruction and the student passes each milestone.
               As a result of this, two things are quite obvious;
               firstly-it is the duty of every muslim aspiring to a higher spiritual level
               to tread the path of toriqah. Secondly-it is not everybody or anybody who possess the porficiency
               to guide others along the path of toriqah. Only a sheikh kaamil can undertake this spiritual
               task.
               Are there any exception to the rule that one does not require guidance from a sheikh
               ? To this we end by examining and reflecting on examples of three muslim
               legends mentioned hereunder, and leaving each person to provide answer for,himself or herself. <br><br>

               Islam without sufism is like body without soul because sufism is the soul. <br>

        <h1>The MAWLID-UN-NABI:Q&A</h1>

        <p><b>
            By sheiky Fakhruddin Owaisi al-Madani(South Africal)<br>
            -What is the ruiling (hukm) regarding celerating the Mawlid-un-Nabi:<br>
            A1:Any action we do may be judge by the Shariah as being of the following five categories:<br>
        </b>
            <b>
            -Fard(Obligatory)<br>
            -Mustahabb(Recommended)<br>
            -Musbah/Jaiz(Simply Permissible)<br>
            -Markruh(Discouraged)<br>
            -Haram(Forbidden)<br>
            </b>
            Past and present Ulama from the four Madhabs (Hanafi, Shafi, Maliki and Hanbali) have<br>
            considered the commemoration of the Prophet (SAW)’ birth as being Mubah, i.e. <br>
            permissible, as there is no evidence in the Shari’ah that prohibits such an event.<br> 
            In fact, there is some evidence that actually supports the commemoration of the noble <br>
            birth. For example: <br>
            -- Allah says in the Qur’an: <br>
            “Say in the Bounty of Allah and His Mercy, Let them rejoice”. (Surah Yunus,
            verse 58). <br>
            There is no greater bounty given to creation than the Holy Prophet (SAW). <br>
            -- The Qur’an narrates to us the stories of the births of Prophets ‘Isa, Musa and Yahya 
            (AS) in an honorable manner.<br> As the greatest of the Prophets, the birth of Nabi 
            Muhammad (SAW) is even more deserving of such attention.<br> 
            -- Imam al-Bukhari narrates that when the Prophet (SAW) was born, his uncle, the <br>
            unbeliever Abu-Lahab freed the slave-girl Thuwaybah that brought him the good news,<br>
            by gesturing to her with his finger. When Abu-Lahab passed away, his brother Sayyidna 
            al-Abbas (RA) saw him in dream and asked him about his condition. He replied:<br>
            “I am in severe punishment, but my punishment is lessened every Monday as I am 
            allowed to suck some water from that finger of mine with which I freed 
            Thuwaybah<br>
            -- It is also narrated by Imam Muslim that the Prophet (SAW) used to fast on Mondays.<br>
            When asked why, he (SAW) replied: “That is the day I was born”. <br>

            That is why many scholars have been very supportive of the Mawlid. For example,<br> the 
            great 9th Century Shafi’i scholar Imam Jalaluddin al-Suyuti writes in his Al-Hawi lil
            Fatawi:<br> 
            “To commemorate the Mawlid, which is basically gathering people together,<br>
            reciting parts of the Qu'ran, narrating stories about the Prophet's birth and the <br>
            signs that accompanied it, then serving food, and afterwards, departing, is one of<br>
            the good innovations; and the one who practices it gets rewarded, because it <br>
            involves venerating the status of the Prophet and expressing joy at his honorable
            birth.” <br>
            However, while commemorating the Mawlid cannot be considered Haram,<br> it also must 
            not be considered Fard.<br> It must be understood that it is simply a beneficial practice that is
            nevertheless not obligatory.<br> 
            Note, too, that while commemorating the Mawlid itself is only Mubah, many of the <br>
            actions done in it are Mustahabb (Recommended) such as recitation of Salawat,<br> coming 
            together of Muslims, discussing the life of the Prophet (SAW), feeding the hungry etc.<br>
            People will undoubtedly be rewarded for these actions. Wa’Llahu A’lam. <br><br>
            <b>Q2-Is commemorating the Mawlid un-Nabi a bid’ah (an innovation)? 
            </b>
            Bid’ah refers to beliefs and practices that appeared after the era of the Holy Prophet<br>
            (SAW). Broadly speaking, bidah’s are acceptable or unacceptable depending upon <br>
            whether or not they fall under the general principles and spirit of the Qur’an and Sunnah.<br>
            Given this they will be classified according to the five Shari‘ah rulings mentioned above.<br>
            Therefore, some bidah’s may be obligatory such as writing books on the din and the<br>
            gathering of the Qur’an and hadith into book form. Some may be recommended such as <br>
            the translation of the Qur’an, the congregational Tarawih prayer and the second adhan,<br>
            for Jumu’ah. Some Bid’ah’s may simply permitted such as performing Eid Salah in 
            Mosques, qira’ah programs,<br> Qur’anic competitions and the commemoration of Mawlid 
            as noted earlier. Depending upon the intention and results, such permitted bidah’s may <br>
            even become recommended. 
            Discouraged innovations would be to have the Holy Qur’an on a cellphone, as some<br>
            Ulama have said. Forbidden bidah’s are any innovated beliefs and practices that are in 
            clear violation of agreed upon principles and rulings of the Shari’ah. <br>
            The hadith that states that “every bidah is a misguidance” refers to this last category of 
            bid’ah only as explained by hadith authority Imam al-Nawawi in his commentary on<br>
            Sahih Muslim (Volume 6, p154): <br>
            “What is meant by it is new matters that are not validated by the Shari’ah. That - 
            and that alone - is what are meant by innovations.” <br><br>
            <b>Q3-Why didn’t the Sahabah commemorate the birth of Prophet (S.A.W)? </b>
            The Prophet (S.A.W) and his Sahabah did not do a LOT of things in their time as there<br>
            was no NEED for it then. Take for instance the Tabligh Jamaat outings of 3 days 40 days<br>
            and hosting Ijtimas. Or Darul-Uloom Jalsas? There were no such things in the time of the<br>
            Sahabah. However, that does not mean that these things are impermissible.<br>
            To judge any gathering, we need to look at its purpose and its contents. <br>
            The purpose of the Mawlid commemorations prevalent in the Ummah for a good<br>
            thousand years at least, is to remind the Muslims of their Prophet (SAW) and what an<br>
            immense blessing of God he was upon us. To unite our hearts around the Prophet (SAW).<br>
            The Sahabah already realized all of this; therefore they had no need for "Mawlid al-Nabi" <br>
            gatherings. They used to meet, greet and see the Prophet (SAW) on a daily basis! <br>
            As for the contents of such Mawlid gatherings such as recitation of Dhikr, Salawat,<br>
            Lectures on Sirah, Coming together of communities, expressions of love and happiness <br>
            and feeding people; then the Sahabah did practice these things. <br>
            It should be noted all the narrations we have regarding what happened during the night of<br>
            the birth of the Prophet (SAW) have been narrated to us by the Sahabah and the Tabi’in! <br>
            Sayyidna Abbas (RA), the uncle of the Prophet (SAW) wrote a poem praising his Birth!<br><br>
            <b>Q4-What is the ruling on standing up to recite Salawat (Salutations) and SalamQ4-What is the ruling on standing up to recite Salawat (Salutations) and Salam

            </b> 
            It is permissible if done with the intention of respecting the Prophet (SAW), and without<br>
            the belief that it is obligatory. The Qur’an has ordered us to present the Salam to the <br>
            Prophet (SAW) in a respectful manner as implied in the verse “Wa Sallimu Taslima” i.e.<br>
            “And send worthy greetings of Peace upon him”. (Qur’an 33:56) <br>
            Furthermore, it is permissible in Islam to stand up to greet any honorable or beloved <br>
            person. The Prophet (SAW) used to stand up to greet many people, including his beloved <br>
            daughter Sayyidah Fatimah Zahra (RA). <br>
            Imam al-Bukhari narrates that once the Prophet (SAW) was sitting in the Mosque and<br>
            saw a funeral passing by. So he immediately stood up in respect of it. He was then told <br>
            that it was actually the funeral of a Jew. So he (SAW) replied; “It is still a soul”. <br>
            The Ulama have also deemed it permissible to stand up for a national anthem. <br>
            It has for centuries been the custom in many Muslim lands to stand up when reciting the<br>
            Salawat and Salam on the Prophet (SAW), especially upon hearing the news of his Birth, <br>
            so as to display love, gratefulness and respect. This practice has been commended and<br> 
            supported by Ulama from all 4 Madhhabs. <br>
            The Mufti of the Shafi’i madhab of Medina al-Imam al-Sayyid Ja’far al-Barzanji wrote in <br>
            his Mawlid that:<br>“Scholars of great character and knowledge have commended the practice of<br>
            standing up at the mention of the Prophet (SAW)’s birth. So glad-tiding to the one <br>
            whose goal and purpose is to honor the Prophet (SAW)”. <br>
            This was written by him in Medina four centuries ago, and he referred to scholars before his time. 
            <br>The Salawat can be recited in all positions: sitting as in the Jalsah (sitting position) <br>
            Salah, or standing as in the Salat-ul-Janazah or even while lying down. <br>
            Furthermore, it is general command of the Shariah to display all sorts of love, honor and <br>
            veneration to the Prophet (SAW) [Qur’an 7:157; 33:6 amongst others], as long as it does <br>
            not involve any prohibited action. Wa’Llahu A’lam. <br><br>
            <b>Q5-Is it possible for the Prophet (SAW) to be present at a Mawlid gathering? 
            </b>
            The blessed body of the Prophet (SAW) is buried in Medina. But his Soul, like the souls <br>
            of all Prophets and pious believers, is free to roam in the Kingdom of Allah to attend <br>
            blessed gatherings. Evidence for this is what occurred on the Night of the Mi’raj when all <br>
            the Prophets gathered in al-Quds to meet and pray behind our Prophet (SAW). Many of <br>
            them met him again in the Heavens. <br>
            Ibn al-Qayyim mentions in his Kitab al-Ruh that the famous Companion Sayyidna <br>
            Salman al-Farisi (RA) said: <br>
            “The souls of the believers are in a partition from the (visible) earth, they go anywhere they want to.” 
            <br><br>
            <b>He also quotes the great Imam Malik as saying: <br>
            </b>“I was informed that the soul is free; it goes anywhere it wants to” <br>
            The above has also been confirmed by great Classical scholars such as Imam al-Suyuti <br>
            and Imam Ibn-Hajar al-Haytami in their Fatawa. <br>
            However, a person who experiences the spiritual presence of the Prophet (SAW) at any <br>
            gathering should normally keep such things to him or herself. In general, this is a matter <br>
            of the unseen and it is best to not to delve into the issue unnecessarily. <br><br>
            
            <b>Q6-What are the Riwayats popularly recited in Cape Town?</b> <br>
                The Riwayats are basically narrations on the happenings of the noble Birth of the Prophet <br>
                (SAW), compiled in a book from by the 16th century Mufti of the Shafi’i madhab in <br>
                Medina al-Imam al-Sayyid Ja’far al-Barzanji. Whatever is mentioned in them is <br>
                authentically sourced from the books of Hadith and Sirah (biographies of the Prophet). It <br>
                is a blessing to recite them as it is a blessing to recite any hadith of the Prophet (SAW). <br>
                Muslim throughout the world recite these Riwayat during the blessed month of Mawlud. <br>
                They are usually referred to in other parts of the world as “Mawlid al-Barzanji”. <br>

       or criticize the science of Sufism, but on the contrary we sopport it, because it purifies<br>
       the external and the internal of the hidden sins which are related to the outward form.Even though the individual<br>
       might externally be on the right way, internally he might be on wrong way. Sufism is necessary to<br> to
       correct it [Ad-Dia'at mukathffa did ash sheiky ibn Abdul Wahhab p,85]<br><br>
       <b>Imam al-juinayd al-Baghdadi:Said defining a sufi:al sufi man labisa al-sufa ala al-safa wa<br>
           ittabaa tariq al-mustafa wa athaqa al-jasada tam al-jafa wa kanat al-dunya minhu ala qafa<br></b>
           The sufi is the one who wears wool on top of purity,followed the path of prophet,<br>
           endured bodily strains dedicating his life to worship and reclining from pleasures,<br>
           and left behind all that pertain to the world.<br>
